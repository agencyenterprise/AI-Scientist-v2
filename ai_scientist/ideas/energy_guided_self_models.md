## TL;DR

By treating a model’s hidden-state dynamics as a physical system, we can compute an “attention energy” that reveals when reasoning becomes incoherent. Pairing this energy metric with attention-schema signals allows AI systems to detect and repair their own failures — moving from passive safety monitoring to *active coherence preservation.*

## Abstract

Modern language models increasingly display the “Gödel Test” failure mode: producing proofs or arguments that look coherent but are, in fact, internally inconsistent. This work proposes a new architecture and experimental protocol — the **Energy-Guided Self-Model (EGSM)** — that integrates Attention Schema Theory (AST) with a physics-inspired energy formalism to detect and repair such failures in real time.

Building on recent theoretical work that defines hidden-state *velocity* (v_t) and point perplexity (\mathrm{PPL}_t = 1/p(x_t)), we define an **attention energy** (E_t = \tfrac{1}{2}|v_t|^2 \cdot \mathrm{PPL}_t). Empirically, high variance or spikes in (E_t) correspond to attention instability and reasoning drift. We combine this with AST’s *Self–Other Overlap* (SOO) metric to detect when a model’s self-predicted coherence diverges from reality. When such divergence is detected, a **tiered repair policy** activates — progressing from local re-evaluation to Jacobian-based steering of hidden states, and finally to global search if coherence remains unstable.

In synthetic Gödel Test simulations, energy variance (CV(E)) correlates strongly (r ≈ 0.5) with contradiction frequency, while the derived consciousness metric correlates positively (r ≈ 0.7) with task performance. When the repair pipeline is triggered by energy/SOO alarms, contradiction rates fall from 100% to 0% in adversarial conditions, demonstrating that introspective self-monitoring can actively enforce coherence rather than merely assess it.

We argue that this **Energy-Guided Self-Model** unifies introspective alignment (AST) and physical interpretability (energy conservation) into a single measurable and controllable substrate. This creates a path toward *self-aware coherence* — models that not only know when they’re wrong but can dynamically steer back toward alignment, offering a measurable foundation for safe and trustworthy AI reasoning systems.
