# RTX 5090 GPU Compatibility Issue

## Problem Summary

Your RunPod instance has **3x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090** GPUs, but these GPUs are **too new** for PyTorch to support.

- **GPU Architecture**: Blackwell (sm_120 / compute capability 12.0)
- **PyTorch Stable**: Supports up to sm_90
- **PyTorch Nightly**: Still only supports up to sm_90 (as of Nov 2024)
- **Result**: All CUDA operations fail with "no kernel image is available for execution on the device"

## Why This Happened

The RTX 5090 was just released and uses NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture with compute capability 12.0. PyTorch needs to compile kernels specifically for each compute capability, and **no PyTorch build includes sm_120 kernels yet** - not even bleeding-edge nightly builds.

This caused all your experiment nodes to fall back to CPU and get marked as "buggy" even though they actually ran successfully on CPU.

## Solutions (In Order of Recommendation)

### ‚≠ê Option 1: Switch to a Supported GPU on RunPod (RECOMMENDED)

Request a new pod with one of these GPUs:

| GPU | Compute Cap | Status | Notes |
|-----|-------------|--------|-------|
| **RTX 4090** | sm_89 | ‚úÖ Fully supported | Excellent performance, latest stable |
| **A100** | sm_80 | ‚úÖ Fully supported | Best for ML, very stable |
| **RTX 3090** | sm_86 | ‚úÖ Fully supported | Good value |
| **RTX 3080** | sm_86 | ‚úÖ Fully supported | Budget option |

**Benefits**:
- Full PyTorch support
- Stable and well-tested
- Better software ecosystem compatibility
- Experiments will run on GPU properly

### Option 2: Force CPU Mode (Quick Workaround)

On your current pod:

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""
# Then rerun your experiments
```

**Pros**: Works immediately
**Cons**: Much slower than GPU, may timeout on large experiments

### Option 3: Wait for PyTorch sm_120 Support

PyTorch will eventually add support for sm_120, but this is likely **weeks or months away**. Not practical if you need to run experiments now.

## What I've Fixed

1. **`log_summarization.py`**: Fixed the crash that occurred when all nodes were marked buggy
2. **`test_gpu_cuda.py`**: Enhanced to detect sm_120 specifically and give tailored recommendations
3. **`init_runpod.sh`**: Will auto-detect RTX 5090 and try to install appropriate PyTorch (though currently none exists)

## Testing

Run the diagnostic script on your pod:

```bash
python test_gpu_cuda.py
```

This will:
- Detect your GPU and compute capability
- Test CUDA operations
- Give specific recommendations for your situation
- Show exactly which operations fail

## Recommendation

üéØ **Best action**: Terminate the current pod and request a new one with **RTX 4090** or **A100** GPUs.

The RTX 5090 is cutting-edge hardware, but the software ecosystem (PyTorch, CUDA libraries, etc.) hasn't caught up yet. For ML research, using slightly older but fully-supported GPUs will give you:
- Better stability
- Faster iteration (no CUDA issues)
- Full ecosystem compatibility
- Similar or better performance (for now)

## Technical Details

The error message from PyTorch:
```
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 with CUDA capability sm_120 is not compatible with the current PyTorch installation.
The current PyTorch install supports CUDA capabilities sm_50 sm_60 sm_70 sm_75 sm_80 sm_86 sm_90.
```

This means PyTorch literally doesn't have compiled CUDA kernels for sm_120. Every CUDA operation will fail until PyTorch adds support.
