## üì¶ Files Changed

### Backend (RunPods) - 4 files
1. **`ai_scientist/treesearch/interpreter.py`**
   - Added spawn multiprocessing (fixes CUDA fork error)
   
2. **`ai_scientist/treesearch/parallel_agent.py`**
   - Added spawn multiprocessing
   - Added event_callback parameter
   - Added 10+ granular log events throughout node processing
   
3. **`ai_scientist/treesearch/agent_manager.py`**
   - Added event_callback parameter
   - Wired callback through to ParallelAgent
   
4. **`ai_scientist/treesearch/perform_experiments_bfts_with_agentmanager.py`**
   - Fixed progress calculation (total_nodes instead of good_nodes)
   - Added status log events (debugging vs found working)
   - Wired event_callback through to AgentManager

### Frontend (Orchestrator) - 3 files
1. **`orchestrator/apps/web/components/RunDetailClient.tsx`**
   - Fixed polling to check current data not initial data
   - Added visual polling indicator (pulsing green dot)
   
2. **`orchestrator/apps/web/components/StageProgressPanel.tsx`**
   - Added real-time elapsed time calculation
   - 1-second tick timer for smooth updates
   
3. **`orchestrator/apps/web/app/api/artifacts/[...key]/route.ts`**
   - Changed from `[key]` to `[...key]` catch-all route
   - Fixed multi-segment paths for plot images

### Tests - 1 new file
1. **`tests/integration/test_observability_events.py`** ‚ú® NEW
   - Tests all 23 granular observability events
   - Verifies progress shows with buggy nodes
   - Confirms events reach MongoDB
   - **ALL 3 TESTS PASSING!**

## üéØ What Each Fix Does

### 1. CUDA Fork Error ‚Üí GPU Works ‚úÖ
**Problem:** `RuntimeError: Cannot re-initialize CUDA in forked subprocess`  
**Fix:** Spawn multiprocessing  
**Result:** Experiments can use GPU without crashes

### 2. Progress Stuck at 0% ‚Üí Shows Real Progress ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Progress only counted good nodes (0 when all buggy)  
**Fix:** Count total attempted nodes  
**Result:** `3/14 (21%)` instead of `0/14 (0%)`

### 3. Elapsed Time Frozen at 0s ‚Üí Live Timer ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Read non-existent `elapsed_s` field  
**Fix:** Calculate from `startedAt` + 1s tick timer  
**Result:** `9m 56s` updates every second

### 4. Frontend Not Polling ‚Üí Auto-Updates ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Checked static initial data  
**Fix:** Dynamic check of current query state  
**Result:** Refreshes every 5 seconds automatically

### 5. Plot Images 404 ‚Üí Images Load ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Route only captured single path segment  
**Fix:** Catch-all route `[...key]`  
**Result:** `runs/{id}/{file}.png` works correctly

### 6. No Visibility ‚Üí Complete Observability ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Silent during code generation, execution, debugging  
**Fix:** 10+ granular log events  
**Result:** See exactly what's happening at all times

## üìã Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to RunPods

```bash
cd /Users/jessica/AEStudio/agi/AI-Scientist-v2

# Create deployment package
bash create_upload_zip.sh

# Upload ai-scientist-runpod.zip to RunPod
# SSH into pod and run:
unzip -o ai-scientist-runpod.zip
python pod_worker.py
```

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Railway/Vercel

```bash
cd orchestrator/apps/web

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete observability system - real-time progress tracking"
git push origin feat/additions

# Deploy via Railway/Vercel (automatic or manual trigger)
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. **Start a new run** from the frontend
2. **Watch the run page** - you should see:
   - ‚úÖ Progress bar moving
   - ‚úÖ Elapsed time ticking (updates every 1s)
   - ‚úÖ Live logs streaming (updates every 2s)
   - ‚úÖ Iteration count increasing
   - ‚úÖ Node counts updating (good/buggy/total)
   - ‚úÖ Green pulsing dot showing polling is active
   - ‚úÖ Plot images loading correctly

## üß™ Test Suite Status

```bash
# Run observability tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_observability_events.py -v

# Results: 3/3 PASSED ‚úÖ
‚úì test_experiment_phase_visibility - All 23 events verified
‚úì test_stage_progress_always_emitted - Progress with 0 good nodes works
‚úì test_log_event_types_displayed - Log levels preserved correctly
```
