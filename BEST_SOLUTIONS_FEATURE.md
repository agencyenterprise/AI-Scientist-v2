# Best Solutions Feature - Easy Code Reproducibility

## Overview

The system now automatically copies the best performing code from each experimental stage to the **root of the experiment directory** for easy access and reproducibility.

## What Gets Created

After an experiment completes, you'll find in the experiment root:

### 1. Best Code Files
```
experiment_dir/
├── best_code_stage_1.py  # Initial Implementation
├── best_code_stage_2.py  # Baseline Tuning
├── best_code_stage_3.py  # Creative Research (MAIN RESULTS)
├── best_code_stage_4.py  # Ablation Studies
└── BEST_SOLUTIONS_README.md
```

### 2. Comprehensive README

The `BEST_SOLUTIONS_README.md` file includes:
- Description of each stage
- Node IDs for traceability
- Original file locations
- Instructions for reproduction
- Explanation of the selection process

## Usage

### For Reproducing Paper Results

Simply run the Stage 3 code:
```bash
cd experiment_dir/
python best_code_stage_3.py
```

Stage 3 (Creative Research) contains the main experimental results used in the paper.

### For Comparing Variations

- **Stage 1**: First working implementation
- **Stage 2**: Hyperparameter-tuned baseline
- **Stage 3**: Main results (creative improvements)
- **Stage 4**: Ablation study variations

## Implementation Details

### When It Runs

The best solutions are copied:
1. **After all stages complete** (Stage 4 finishes)
2. **Before archiving** to MinIO/S3
3. **Automatically** - no manual intervention needed

### Selection Process

The "best" code for each stage is selected using:
1. **Performance metrics** (validation loss, accuracy, etc.)
2. **Training dynamics** (convergence, stability)
3. **Plot quality** and experimental evidence
4. **LLM evaluation** (GPT-5-mini) considering all factors holistically

See the journal files in `logs/0-run/<stage_name>/journal.json` for complete selection reasoning.

### Files Modified

- `pod_worker.py`: Added `copy_best_solutions_to_root()` function
- `launch_scientist_bfts.py`: Added same function for local runs
- Both scripts call this function after Stage 4 completes

## Benefits

✅ **Easy reproducibility** - No need to navigate complex directory structures  
✅ **Clear identification** - Obvious which code produced which results  
✅ **Comprehensive documentation** - README explains everything  
✅ **Automatic** - Works for both local and RunPod experiments  
✅ **Traceable** - Node IDs link back to full experimental history  
✅ **Archive-ready** - Included in the MinIO archive upload

## Example README Output

```markdown
# Best Solution Code for Reproducibility

This directory contains the best performing code from each experimental stage.
Use these files to reproduce the results reported in the paper.

## Files

### `best_code_stage_1.py`

- **Stage**: Initial Implementation - First working version of the idea
- **Node ID**: `7d4bc654944c4f9683d713781235d70a`
- **Original location**: `logs/0-run/stage_1_initial_implementation_1_preliminary/best_solution_7d4bc654944c4f9683d713781235d70a.py`
- **Stage directory**: `stage_1_initial_implementation_1_preliminary`

### `best_code_stage_3.py`

- **Stage**: Creative Research - **Main results used in paper**
- **Node ID**: `12fc59e1fbd24aa09e733dcdfbe2b7c5`
- **Original location**: `logs/0-run/stage_3_creative_research_1_first_attempt/best_solution_12fc59e1fbd24aa09e733dcdfbe2b7c5.py`
- **Stage directory**: `stage_3_creative_research_1_first_attempt`

## How to Use

For reproducing the main paper results, use **`best_code_stage_3.py`** (Creative Research stage).

```bash
# Run the best code
python best_code_stage_3.py
```

## Selection Process

The best code for each stage was selected using:
- Performance metrics (validation loss, accuracy, etc.)
- Training dynamics
- Plot quality and experimental evidence
- LLM-based evaluation (GPT-5-mini) considering all factors

See `logs/0-run/<stage_name>/journal.json` for the complete experimental history and selection reasoning.
```

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Include requirements.txt with dependencies
- Add data download scripts
- Include environment setup instructions
- Generate reproduction test scripts

## Technical Notes

The function is robust and handles:
- Missing stage directories gracefully
- Multiple stage attempts (uses first matching)
- Error cases without failing the experiment
- Both Path and string-based file operations
