# Stage Observability Enhancement Complete

## Summary
✅ **All 4 stages now emit comprehensive start/stop events and detailed progress logs**

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Stage Event Emission
**ALL stages now wrapped in `StageContext`** which automatically emits:
- `ai.run.stage_started` - When stage begins
- `ai.run.stage_completed` - When stage ends (with duration)
- `ai.run.failed` - If any error occurs (with traceback)

### ✅ Detailed Observability Added

#### **Stage 1: Preliminary Investigation (BFTS Experiments)**
- Logs max iterations from config
- Logs experiment configuration path
- Reports when experiments complete
- Progress tracked via node events (already existed)

#### **Stage 2: Baseline Tuning (Plot Aggregation)**
- Reports existing plots count
- Logs LLM model being used for aggregation
- Progress updates: 0% → 25% → 75% → 100%
- Reports final figure count
- Uploads all figures as artifacts
- Warns if no figures directory created

#### **Stage 3: Research Agenda Execution (Paper Generation)**
- Logs citation gathering start with model name and rounds
- Progress: 0% → 10% (citations) → 40% → 80% (writeup) → 100%
- Reports citation count gathered
- Logs writeup model and page limit
- Reports PDF file size and name
- Logs backup location
- Reports upload success/failure
- Errors logged if PDF not found

#### **Stage 4: Ablation Studies (Auto-validation)**
- Logs review model being used
- Progress: 0% → 20% (loading) → 40% (loaded) → 70% (reviewing) → 90% → 100%
- Reports paper content length
- Logs individual review scores (e.g., "clarity: 8.5, novelty: 7.0")
- Reports validation verdict
- Errors logged if no PDF available

## Event Types Emitted

### Stage Lifecycle (All Stages)
```
ai.run.stage_started    → Stage begins
ai.run.stage_completed  → Stage ends with duration_s
ai.run.failed          → If error occurs
```

### Logs (All Stages)
```
ai.run.log → Detailed progress messages with levels:
  - info: Normal progress updates
  - warning: Non-critical issues
  - error: Critical problems
```

### Stage-Specific Events
```
Stage 1: ai.node.* events (created, executing, completed, selected_best)
Stage 2: ai.artifact.registered (for figures)
Stage 3: ai.paper.started, ai.paper.generated, ai.artifact.registered
Stage 4: ai.validation.auto_started, ai.validation.auto_completed
```

## Frontend Benefits

The frontend now has **complete observability** into:

1. **What stage is running** - Real-time stage name and description
2. **Progress within each stage** - 0-100% granular updates
3. **What's happening now** - Detailed log messages
4. **Intermediate results** - Plot counts, citation counts, PDF sizes, review scores
5. **Issues and warnings** - Missing files, upload failures, etc.
6. **Exact timing** - Stage durations calculated automatically
7. **Full error context** - Complete tracebacks if anything fails

## Database Progress Tracking

Each stage updates `currentStage.progress` in the database:
- Stage 1: Updated by node events (iteration-based)
- Stage 2: 0% → 25% → 75% → 100%
- Stage 3: 0% → 10% → 40% → 80% → 100%
- Stage 4: 0% → 20% → 40% → 70% → 90% → 100%

## No More Mock Functions

✅ All event emission is real and production-ready
✅ No mock functions in `event_emitter.py`
✅ Mocks only exist in test files (as expected)

## Example Log Stream

```
Stage 1:
→ ai.run.stage_started (Stage_1: Preliminary Investigation)
→ ai.run.log: "Starting preliminary investigation (BFTS experiments)"
→ ai.run.log: "Max iterations for Stage_1: 5"
→ ai.node.created, ai.node.executing, ai.node.completed... (many)
→ ai.run.log: "Stage_1 experiments completed"
→ ai.run.stage_completed (duration_s: 3600)

Stage 2:
→ ai.run.stage_started (Stage_2: Baseline Tuning)
→ ai.run.log: "Starting plot aggregation"
→ ai.run.log: "Found 12 existing plots to aggregate"
→ ai.run.log: "Generating aggregator script using model: gpt-5-mini"
→ ai.run.log: "Generated 8 final figures"
→ ai.artifact.registered (for each figure)
→ ai.run.stage_completed (duration_s: 180)

Stage 3:
→ ai.run.stage_started (Stage_3: Research Agenda Execution)
→ ai.paper.started
→ ai.run.log: "Gathering citations using model: gpt-5-mini (15 rounds)"
→ ai.run.log: "Gathered 45 lines of citations"
→ ai.run.log: "Starting writeup generation using model: gpt-5 (4 pages max)"
→ ai.run.log: "Generated PDF: paper.pdf (2.34 MB)"
→ ai.run.log: "Paper uploaded successfully"
→ ai.paper.generated
→ ai.run.stage_completed (duration_s: 900)

Stage 4:
→ ai.run.stage_started (Stage_4: Ablation Studies)
→ ai.validation.auto_started
→ ai.run.log: "Using review model: gpt-5-mini"
→ ai.run.log: "Loaded paper content (45230 characters)"
→ ai.run.log: "Sending paper to LLM for review"
→ ai.run.log: "Review scores: clarity: 8.5, novelty: 7.0, soundness: 8.0"
→ ai.run.log: "Validation verdict: pass"
→ ai.validation.auto_completed
→ ai.run.stage_completed (duration_s: 120)
```

## Testing

All existing tests still pass:
- Unit tests validate event emission
- Integration tests verify stage context behavior
- E2E tests check complete pipeline flow

## Ready for Production

✅ All stages emit proper events
✅ Frontend has full visibility
✅ No missing observability gaps
✅ Production-ready event emission
