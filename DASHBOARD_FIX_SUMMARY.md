# Dashboard Visualization Fixes - Summary

## Problem Identified

You were right to be frustrated! The dashboard wasn't showing critical information even though the data was being collected.

### Root Cause
**`pod_worker.py` line 669-677** was only persisting 2 fields to MongoDB:
```python
"currentStage": {
    "name": display_name,
    "progress": progress  # Only 2 fields!
}
```

But the frontend (`StageProgressPanel.tsx`) was trying to display:
- ✅ `name` - Working
- ✅ `progress` - Working
- ❌ `iteration` / `maxIterations` - Missing!
- ❌ `goodNodes` / `buggyNodes` / `totalNodes` - Missing!
- ❌ `bestMetric` - Missing!

The rich data was being collected by the BFTS system and emitted via events, but **thrown away** before reaching MongoDB.

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix #1: Persist All Stage Progress Data (CRITICAL)
**File**: `pod_worker.py` lines 669-683

**Before**: Only stored `name` and `progress`

**After**: Now stores all 7 fields:
```python
"currentStage": {
    "name": display_name,
    "progress": progress,
    "iteration": iteration,
    "maxIterations": max_iterations,
    "goodNodes": good_nodes,
    "buggyNodes": buggy_nodes,
    "totalNodes": total_nodes,
    "bestMetric": data.get("best_metric")
}
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ You'll now see "Iteration: X/Y" 
- ✅ You'll see "Nodes: X good / Y buggy / Z total"
- ✅ You'll see the best metric value
- ✅ ETA calculation will work (based on iteration progress)

### ✅ Fix #2: Current Activity Banner (HIGH VISIBILITY)
**New File**: `orchestrator/apps/web/components/CurrentActivityBanner.tsx`

A prominent banner at the top of running experiments that shows:
- 🎯 **Latest activity message** (e.g., "📤 Submitting 3 node(s): 2 new draft(s), 1 debugging")
- 🔴 Color-coded by severity (green for success, amber for warnings, red for errors)
- 🕐 Timestamp of the activity
- ⚡ Updates every 2 seconds
- 💫 Animated pulse indicator

**Modified**: `orchestrator/apps/web/components/RunDetailClient.tsx`
- Added import for `CurrentActivityBanner`
- Displays banner right after header when run is RUNNING
- Automatically polls for latest log event

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Immediately see "what is the system doing RIGHT NOW"
- ✅ Know if it's frozen vs actively working
- ✅ See debugging vs drafting vs improving activity
- ✅ Visual feedback that the system is alive

## What You'll See Now

### Before (What You Were Frustrated About)
```
Stage 1: Preliminary Investigation
Progress: 0%
[That's it - no other info!]
```

### After (What You'll See Next Run)
```
🔵 📤 Submitting 3 node(s): 2 new draft(s), 1 debugging  [10:28:45 AM]

Stage 1: Preliminary Investigation - 34%

Iteration: 2/5
Nodes: 0 good / 3 buggy / 3 total
Elapsed: 6m 35s
ETA: ~13m 12s

Best Metric:
Metrics(validation R↑[closed_loop:(final=0.3418, best=0.3418)])
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Immediate Verification
1. Start a new experiment run
2. Navigate to the run detail page
3. You should now see:
   - ✅ Current activity banner showing latest action
   - ✅ Iteration count (e.g., "1/5", "2/5")
   - ✅ Node counts with color coding
   - ✅ Best metric display
   - ✅ Working ETA estimate

### What to Watch For
- Banner should update every 2 seconds with new messages
- Node counts should increment as experiments run
- Progress bar should move smoothly based on iterations
- Best metric should update when better nodes are found

## Additional Context: What Data Exists

Your system collects **extremely rich data** per node:
```javascript
{
  code: "...",              // Full generated Python code
  plan: "...",              // Experiment plan
  analysis: "...",          // Detailed bug analysis (300-500 words!)
  metric: {...},            // Structured multi-dataset metrics
  plots: [...],             // Generated plot filenames
  plot_analyses: {...},     // LLM analysis of each plot
  _term_out: [...],         // Raw terminal output
  exec_time: 0.456,         // Execution duration
  is_buggy: true/false,     // Bug status
  parent_id: "...",         // Tree relationship
  vlm_feedback_summary: "..." // Visual analysis
}
```

### Still Not Displayed (But Easy to Add)
See `DASHBOARD_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for 20 prioritized improvements with effort estimates.

**Highest value next additions:**
1. ✅ **DONE**: Current activity banner
2. 🎯 **Next**: Node list viewer (see all attempts with status)
3. 🎯 **Next**: Bug analysis display (show WHY nodes failed)
4. 🎯 **Next**: Code diff viewer (compare attempts)

## Files Modified

### Python (Backend)
- ✅ `pod_worker.py` (lines 669-683) - Store all stage progress fields

### TypeScript (Frontend)  
- ✅ `orchestrator/apps/web/components/CurrentActivityBanner.tsx` (NEW) - Activity banner component
- ✅ `orchestrator/apps/web/components/RunDetailClient.tsx` (lines 25, 147-149) - Added banner import and display

### Documentation
- ✅ `DASHBOARD_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (NEW) - Comprehensive improvement roadmap
- ✅ `DASHBOARD_FIX_SUMMARY.md` (THIS FILE) - Fix summary

## No Breaking Changes

✅ All changes are backward compatible
✅ No database migrations needed (MongoDB is schemaless)
✅ Old runs will show what data they have
✅ New runs will show all the new fields
✅ No changes to the BFTS experiment system itself

## Next Steps

1. **Test**: Start a new experiment and verify the new UI elements
2. **Monitor**: Watch the activity banner and node counts update
3. **Feedback**: Let me know what additional information would be most valuable
4. **Iterate**: We can add more visualizations based on priority

## Questions Answered

### "What is happening inside stage 1?"
✅ Now visible via activity banner + iteration count + node breakdown

### "Is it choosing a node, generating code, what?"
✅ Activity banner shows "📤 Submitting N node(s): X new drafts, Y debugging"

### "How much of the stage has been completed?"
✅ Progress bar + iteration count (e.g., "3/5") + percentage

### "Is it a data or visualization problem?"
✅ Was a **data persistence bug** - data existed but wasn't stored in MongoDB
✅ Now fixed - frontend can display what backend collects

## Technical Notes

### Why MongoDB Updates?
The BFTS system emits events with rich data, but those events are ephemeral. The frontend queries MongoDB for persistent state. The bug was that `pod_worker.py` (the bridge between BFTS and MongoDB) was discarding most of the data during the MongoDB update.

### Why Not Just Use Events?
Events are great for real-time updates but not for persistent state. If you refresh the page or join mid-run, you need the current state from MongoDB. Events + MongoDB gives you both real-time updates AND persistent state.

### Performance Impact
✅ Negligible - we're storing 5 more fields (iteration, maxIterations, 3 node counts) per MongoDB update
✅ Activity banner polls every 2 seconds for 1 event (very lightweight)
✅ No impact on experiment execution speed

---

**Status**: ✅ Ready for testing
**Risk**: Low - backward compatible, no breaking changes
**Impact**: HIGH - transforms user experience from "is it frozen?" to "I can see exactly what's happening"
