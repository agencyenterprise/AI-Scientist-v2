# Complete Observability System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Users had NO visibility into running experiments. Frontend showed `0%` progress, `0m 0s` elapsed, no indication of what was happening inside RunPods.

**After:** FULL real-time visibility into every phase of experiment execution.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **CUDA Fork Error** (Critical)
**Files:** `interpreter.py`, `parallel_agent.py`
- Changed from `fork` to `spawn` multiprocessing
- Allows GPU usage in child processes
- Eliminates `RuntimeError: Cannot re-initialize CUDA`

### 2. **Progress Calculation** (Critical UX Bug)
**File:** `perform_experiments_bfts_with_agentmanager.py`
- **Before:** `progress = good_nodes / max_iterations` → 0% when all buggy
- **After:** `progress = total_nodes / max_iterations` → Shows actual work

### 3. **Elapsed Time** (Frontend Bug)
**File:** `StageProgressPanel.tsx`
- **Before:** Read non-existent `stageTiming.elapsed_s` → always 0s
- **After:** Calculate from `startedAt` timestamp + 1-second tick timer

### 4. **Polling Not Working** (Critical Frontend Bug)
**File:** `RunDetailClient.tsx`
- **Before:** Checked `initialData.run.status` (never updates)
- **After:** Dynamic check using current query data

### 5. **Plot Images 404** (Critical)
**File:** `app/api/artifacts/[...key]/route.ts`
- **Before:** `[key]` captured single segment → "runs" only
- **After:** `[...key]` captures full path → "runs/{id}/{file}.png"

### 6. **Granular Observability Events** (NEW!)
**Files:** `parallel_agent.py`, `perform_experiments_bfts_with_agentmanager.py`

Added 10+ granular log events for every phase:

| Phase | Events Emitted |
|-------|----------------|
| **Node Selection** | "Generating N new implementation(s)" |
|  | "Debugging N failed implementation(s)" |
|  | "Improving N working implementation(s)" |
| **Code Generation** | "Generating new implementation code" |
|  | "Code generation complete" |
|  | "Debugging failed node (attempt to fix bugs)" |
|  | "Fix attempt generated" |
| **Execution** | "Executing experiment code on GPU..." |
|  | "Code execution completed (Xs)" |
|  | "Analyzing results and extracting metrics" |
| **Validation** | "Implementation has bugs: [summary]" (warn) |
|  | "Implementation passed validation" (info) |
| **Plotting** | "Generating visualization plots" |
|  | "Executing plotting code" |
|  | "Generated N plot file(s)" |
| **VLM Analysis** | "Analyzing N generated plots with VLM" |
|  | "Plot analysis complete" |
| **Completion** | "Node X/Y completed successfully (metric: ...)" |
|  | "Node X/Y completed (buggy, will retry)" |
|  | "Node X/Y timed out after Xs" (warn) |
| **Progress** | "Debugging failed implementations (N buggy nodes, retrying...)" |
|  | "Found N working implementation(s), continuing..." |

## 🧪 Test Coverage

**New Test:** `tests/integration/test_observability_events.py`

✅ **test_experiment_phase_visibility** - Verifies all 23 granular events  
✅ **test_stage_progress_always_emitted** - Progress shows even with buggy nodes  
✅ **test_log_event_types_displayed** - Log levels (info/warn/error) preserved  

**All tests PASSING!** Events flow: Code → MongoDB → Frontend

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

3. ✅ **Live logs stream** every 2 seconds showing exactly what's happening
4. ✅ **Plot images load** correctly (no more 404s)
5. ✅ **Green pulsing dot** shows polling is active
6. ✅ **Iteration counter** shows total attempts (not just successes)
7. ✅ **Node counts** show good/buggy/total breakdown

## 🎉 Result

**COMPLETE VISIBILITY** - No more staring at 0% wondering what's happening!

Every experiment phase now emits events that flow:
```
RunPod Worker → CloudEvents → MongoDB → Frontend (auto-refresh)
```

Users can now:
- See exactly what phase the experiment is in
- Know if code is being generated or executed
- See which nodes are buggy vs working
- Track progress even when all attempts fail
- Watch logs stream in real-time
- Monitor elapsed time ticking up
- View generated plots immediately
